    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>

        <li>2 medium carrots, quartered and diced</li>

        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh basil, roughly chopped + extra for garnish</li>
        <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 medium egg</li>
        <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
        <li>¼ cup parmesan cheese, grated</li>
        <li>2 cups marinara</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Coarse salt, ground black pepper to taste</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease a 9x13 casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Whisk together egg and ricotta in a small bowl until smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook lasagna noodles according to box instructions. Rinse with cold water, drain, and set aside.</li>
        <li>While the noodles are boiling, heat olive oil to a large skillet over medium high heat.</li>
        <li>Stir in zucchini, carrots, and onion. Cook until somewhat softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add basil, spinach, and garlic, cook until spinach is wilted and garlic is fragrant, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Spread ¼ cup of the marinara sauce on the bottom of the prepared casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Lay 3 noodles into the dish, cutting as necessary to fit. Spread evenly with ½ cup of the marinara sauce and ⅓ of the egg ricotta mixture. Evenly sprinkle ⅓ of the cooked vegetable mixture and top with ½ cup of mozzarella cheese. Repeat this process twice more for two more layers.</li>
        <li>Top final layer with last 3 noodles. Spread with the last of the marinara sauce and sprinkle with parmesan cheese and remaining mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30 minutes until sauce is bubbling and cheese is golden. Let cool for 10 minutes. Garnish with freshly chopped basil.</li>

    </ol>
